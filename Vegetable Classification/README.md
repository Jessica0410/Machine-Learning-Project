# Vegetable Classification Using NN

There are definitely superior Machine Learning or Deep Learning Methods to solve this problem, but in order to help all 
the data science savvies get better understanding of Neural Network. I used Neural Network in this implementation, and 
I might provide more solutions to this solve this problem after I learn other types of machine learning methods.

**The accuracy of this model achieved 85.8%** 

### Dataset

The dataset choosen is vegetable dataset containing 21,000 images:
- training set contains 15,000 examples
- test set contains 3,000 examples
- validation set contains 3,000 examples

The vegetables aims to be classified into 15 different types:
- Bean
- Bitter Gourd
- Bottle Gourd
- Brinjal
- Cabbage
- Capsicum
- Carrot
- Cauliflower
- Cucumber
- Papaya
- Potato
- Pumpkin
- Radish
- Tomato

You can access to this dataset via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset), as the
dataset is too big to upload to Github.
