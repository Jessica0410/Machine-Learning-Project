This is a multiple linear regression project, where the input features are more than one.
The [insurance](https://github.com/Jessica0410/LinearRegression/blob/main/InsurancePrediction/insurance.csv) dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
This code checks the correlation between charges and every single feature
This project also provides multiple ways to visualize the data: barplot, scatter plot, box plot, violin plot...
The model implementation is done by two ways: using sklearn and building by ourselves
